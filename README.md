## Welcome to TigerTasks!
TigerTasks helps Princeton students get tasks done through the Browse and the 
Create features. With the Browse Tasks page, a user can earn some money
or just help out a fellow Tiger by searching through added tasks. With the 
Create Tasks page, a user can add a task they need done in any capacity, whether it be
designing a logo for a personal project, getting tutoring for a difficult class,
or even a basic need like grocery shopping one weekend. TigerTasks combines
all these things to make it easier for Princeton students to get tasks done.

## Browsing Tasks
Once you've logged in with your Princeton email, you see the Browse Tasks section, where
all available tasks are listed.

In order to better search through these, feel free to use the title and category filters
to find the task you are best suited to accomplish.

While you're searching, you may come along tasks that you are interested in. For tasks 
with longer descriptions, press the see more button to view the entire task.

If the task really interests you and you want to save it for easier finding, press the flag in the top right of the card,
which then saves it to your Flagged Tasks. To see these, switch to the My Tasks tab and scroll down.

To request a task, use the contact info added to the card to message/email the owner and set up
anything you need.

## Creating Tasks
In the Browse Tasks section, you'll see an Add New Task button. Click it to bring up the form
to add a new task. Here, fill out the necessary fields. Some fields with an asterisk are required, while the others are not,
but it's best to fill out as much information as you can for those browsing.

Once you've added a task, you can see all the tasks you've created in the My Tasks section.

Here, you can edit any of your created tasks, or delete them once they've been completed or once you no longer
wish to have the task available. Pressing edit brings up a similar form to edit the task:

Pressing delete gives you a confirmation dialog, since this cannot be undone.
